# MIT_OCW_NewsFilter
Last problem in MIT OpenCourseWare. 
Object-oriented programming (classes and inheritance) was used to build a program to monitor news feeds over the Internet.
The program will filter the news, alerting the user when it notices a news story that matches that user's interests. 
(for example, the user may be interested in a notification whenever a story related to the Red Sox is posted)
